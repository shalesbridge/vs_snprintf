snprintf_compat
===============

This is a small wrapper library to provide a _snprintf_ function for older
versions of Visual Studio, which lack a native _snprintf_.

The new _snprintf_ function provided should behave like the standard C
_snprintf_.

This library was created explicitly to be public domain, so that anyone can use
it for any project, including commercial ones.

This library does its best to detect when it is being used on a compiler that
already comes with _snprintf_, in which case it will `#include "stdio.h"`, where
_snprintf_ usually resides.  This way, you can simply include this library in
your project and know that it (hopefully) did "the right thing" to make
_snprintf_ available.

## Compiling

A _CMakeLists.txt_ file has been included for use with _cmake_.  To generate
makefiles for your system, run:

> cmake .

...however, you probably just want to copy `snprintf_compat.c` and
`snprintf_compat.h` into your project and include them in your build system of
choice.


## Unit Testing

To generate makefiles that will include unit testing targets, run:

> cmake -Dtest=on .
